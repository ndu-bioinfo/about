            Welcome to my personal website! I'm a computational biologist and bioinformatics scientist with a passion for integrating computational strategies into biological research.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my PhD, I dove deep into researching pathways associated with high light stress in a marine diatom by applying fluxomic and transcriptomic data. This journey had me spending countless hours in the wet lab, collecting and analyzing data to build accurate computational models.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my professional career as a postdoctoral researcher and industry scientist, I've dedicated much of my time to collaborating with sequencing teams to build and optimize pipelines tailored to research needs. I ensure quality assurance policies are effectively implemented by integrating QC checks into these pipelines. Working closely with wet lab teams, I've developed custom tools to enhance workflow efficiency and troubleshoot issues. My role also involves data management, including building and maintaining databases and creating APIs for data querying and visualization. Notably, I built two production-level pipelines that laid the foundation for on/off-target analysis and risk assessment in a major project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another significant aspect of my work is developing and refining algorithms to tackle critical challenges in research operations. I optimized a bait design workflow, reducing sequencing costs by $9â€“$11 per sample. I also designed a machine learning tool called "Gap Triage" that streamlined the QA process for targeted DNA sequencing quality, cutting the timeline from two months to just two weeks. Most recently, I've been working on using Bayesian inference to optimize dose-response curve fitting for more robust off-target signal detection.

        <p>
            I'm committed to driving innovation and efficiency in biological research through computational methods. Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my work and passions!
