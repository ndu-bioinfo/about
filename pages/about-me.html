    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My scientific journey began with modeling the quantum efficiency of microalgae in the ocean. At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I had the privilege of working with leading scientists in marine biology, chemistry, physics, and data science. My research focused on <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em>, a diatom responsible for producing a significant portion of the Earth’s oxygen—up to 50% of what we breathe. These organisms have evolved to thrive in the ever-changing light conditions of the ocean by maintaining high quantum efficiency, which fascinated me.

        Unlike most plants, which are adapted to specific light conditions, <em>P. tricornutum</em> can function efficiently in both high and low sunlight. Through a fluxomics approach, we traced the energy flow within the organism, revealing a pathway that regulates energy transfer between the light-harvesting complex and the reaction center. This pathway allows <em>P. tricornutum</em> to dynamically adjust its energy flow to suit fluctuating light intensities, showcasing an impressive example of nature’s adaptability.

        This experience made me fall in love with the potential of data science to reveal the hidden complexities of biological systems. The more I dug into the data, the more I saw how computational approaches could provide answers to questions we didn’t even know how to ask. After my Ph.D., I felt a strong desire to apply my skills to something that could directly impact people’s lives—human health.
    </p>
    <p>
        That led me to the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, where I began to immerse myself in human genomics. I remember the first time I worked on RNA-seq data, mapping immune responses for lung disease research. It felt like I was zooming in on the microscopic workings of the body, unlocking secrets that could one day lead to better treatments. I spent countless hours developing pipelines for single-cell analysis, all while collaborating with brilliant researchers who were just as passionate as I was about using science to improve lives.

        From there, I joined Invitae Corporation and took on a new challenge—genetic diagnostics. It was a steep learning curve, but I was driven by the opportunity to develop assays that would be used in clinical settings, helping patients get accurate diagnoses faster. The sense of urgency pushed me to streamline our processes, using machine learning to drastically cut down the time required to assess genetic variants. I still remember the satisfaction of watching the system I built cut the QA time from two months to two weeks—it was like turning a complex puzzle into something manageable.
    </p>
    <p>
        My latest chapter brought me to Creyon Bio, where I delved into drug discovery. Here, I was able to bring everything together—Bayesian models, machine learning, and all the knowledge I’d gained—to help detect targets for rare diseases. Working on TNPO2 drug discovery was exhilarating, knowing that the research could potentially change lives. Every day was a reminder of why I chose this path.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, as I continue to explore the possibilities of bioinformatics and computational biology, I’m driven by the belief that data holds the key to so many of the mysteries we face in healthcare. And it’s my mission to keep unlocking them.
